\label{app:gnn-nas}

The research group at DeepInMotion is currently engaged in a project that develops a \gls{GNN}-\gls{NAS} framework for \gls{HAR}. By giving us access to the codebase and providing 38 trained architectures with the corresponding validation accuracy, we could perform a small experiment similar to what is conducted in this thesis. We calculated the Spearman Correlation for every zero-cost proxy using this thesis's developed Zero-Cost framework (\cref{sec:zc-framework}). The results are presented in \cref{tab:gnn-nac-zc}.

\end{table}

The results show that both Grad Norm and Snip exhibit very strong correlation with a Spearman Rank Correlation of $(0.8720, 0.8989)$ and $(0.7938, 0.8097)$, respectively. Note that with only 38 data points, the analysis might lack the statistical power needed to detect the correlation confidently. Nevertheless, the results show great potential and can be a good option to include in the framework in the future.
