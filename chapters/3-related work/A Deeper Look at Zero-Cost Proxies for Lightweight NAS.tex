\subsection{A Deeper Look at Zero-Cost Proxies for Lightweight NAS}

Building upon the research of \cite{abdelfattah2021zero}, \cite{colin2022adeeperlook} delved deeper into the domain of zero-cost proxies for \gls{NAS}. The team extensively analysed existing work regarding zero-cost proxies and performed novel experiments on the NAS-Bench-360 \autocite{tu2021bench} and TransNAS-Bench-101 \autocite{duan2021transnas} benchmarks to increase the range of datasets and tasks involved.

In addition to the six zero-cost proxies in \cite{abdelfattah2021zero}, the paper added two baseline zero-cost proxies (\gls{FLOPs} and params). Their research shows that the zero-cost proxies perform unstable across different tasks and that no current zero-cost proxy consistently outperforms the others. 

They argue that zero-cost proxies should be considered "weak learners", which can rapidly enhance the performance and effectiveness of other techniques within \gls{NAS}.
