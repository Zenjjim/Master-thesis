\section{Exploration of Zero-Cost Proxies via Warmup Strategy}
\subsection{Theoretical and Practical Considerations}

The primary objective of \gls{NAS} is to discover high-performing architectures while minimising computational overhead. Training numerous architectures for a large number of epochs is computationally prohibitive. Training architectures for a limited number of epochs may be a more viable approach. In this context, the authors introduce the concept of a warmup strategy in this study, which aims to determine an optimal epoch threshold that can provide a reliable estimation of the relative performance of different architectures.

The underlying principle for this strategy is based on the assumption that training an architecture for $x$ epochs offers a more efficient evaluation than training the same architecture for $y$ epochs if $x < y$. By identifying an appropriate warmup threshold, researchers can effectively balance the trade-off between computational expense and the accuracy of architecture performance estimation.

To achieve this, each architecture is trained for a predetermined number of warmup epochs, and the zero-cost proxies are calculated at each epoch. Then, for every epoch, the Spearman Rank correlation coefficient between the zero-cost proxies and the final validation accuracy for all architectures is calculated. The epoch with the highest correlation is considered the optimal warmup point.
