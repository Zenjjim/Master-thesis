\section{Combining Zero-Cost Proxies}

Upon analysing the outcomes derived from addressing research question 1 and research question 2, it became necessary to reconsider the experimental plan. The insights gained from the initial results prompted further exploration into utilising zero-cost proxies. Consequently, a decision was made to undertake additional ad hoc experiments to delve deeper into this area of investigation.
