\subsection{Vote}




After sorting, the results will only display the top-5 combinations as too many values will be shown. However, from the results shown in \cref{tab:vote}, all combinations of metrics exhibit almost the same custom correlation measure (majority vote score) of $ > 0.788$. This suggests that these combinations of metrics perform similarly in terms of the agreement between the majority of metrics and accuracy differences.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Vote scores}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{synflow, zen, fisher} & \textbf{0.7899} \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{\cellcolor{verylightgray}synflow, zen, nwot} & \cellcolor{verylightgray}$0.7888$ \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{synflow, zen, flops} & $0.7885$ \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{\cellcolor{verylightgray}synflow, zen, plain} & \cellcolor{verylightgray}$0.7883$ \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{synflow, zen, grad\_norm} & $0.7883$ \\
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:vote}
\end{table}

It is important to note that these results are based on the custom correlation measure (see \cref{subsec:vote}), which differs from standard correlation measures such as Spearman's rank correlation. The custom correlation measure captures the extent to which the majority of metric differences agree with the differences in dataset accuracies. A higher correlation value indicates a stronger agreement, while a lower correlation value suggests a weaker agreement.
