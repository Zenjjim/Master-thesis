\section{Problem Statement}\label{ProblemStatement}
In recent years, \gls{NAS} has emerged as a promising technique for automating designing neural networks with excellent performance on specific tasks \autocite{zoph2016neural}. Several studies have shown that \gls{NAS} can effectively identify suitable architectures for \gls{GCN} problems. Particularly in the field of \gls{HAR}, \gls{GCN} have demonstrated their utility due to the representation of the human body as a graph. 

Despite the recent advancements in \gls{NAS} for \gls{GCN}, evaluating architectures in existing studies remains a significant challenge. It is often infeasible to thoroughly train each candidate's architecture to obtain its ground truth accuracy \autocite{zoph2016neural}. This issue is particularly pressing in resource-constrained environments, where training large numbers of models is infeasible.

Moreover, a significant limitation of the existing literature on \gls{GCN}-\gls{NAS} is the absence of performance predictors, further complicating the optimisation process. The lack of such predictors can make it challenging to efficiently identify the most promising architectures for a given task. Novel approaches, such as zero-cost proxies, have been proposed to predict candidate architectures' performance without requiring full training.

However, there is still much work to be done in exploring the usefulness of these approaches and optimising them for \gls{GCN}-\gls{NAS}.
