\section{Research Method}
We conducted a comprehensive literature review in the fall of 2022 to understand current state-of-the-art approaches in the \gls{NAS} field. Additionally, a thorough analysis of existing papers concentrating on performance predictors within the \gls{NAS} domain was completed. The project's conclusion presents several recommendations for advancing research in the \gls{NAS} field based on the insights gained from the review.

The research plan involves conducting multiple quantitative investigations to examine the performance and behaviour of zero-cost proxies on a \gls{HAR} dataset. Subsequently, the study aims to explore the potential of these proxies in improving \gls{NAS} algorithms.
