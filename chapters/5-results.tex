\chapter{Results}\label{results}

This chapter outlines the study's findings, responding to the defined research questions. The first section evaluates the capability of zero-cost proxies in ranking \gls{GCN} architectures concerning their validation accuracy. Subsequently, the correlation analysis during the warm-up phase of \gls{GCN} training is identified. Lastly, \cref{subsec:r_vote,sec:r_wam} examines techniques for combining zero-cost proxies to improve efficiency and accuracy in \gls{NAS} algorithms.
