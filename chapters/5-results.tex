In this chapter, we present the results of our investigation into the use of zero-cost proxies in neural architecture search (\gls{NAS}) for graph convolutional networks (\gls{GCN}). We address three research questions about using proxies in \gls{NAS} for \gls{GCN}, as outlined in the introduction chapter (\ref{section:goalsandrq}). Specifically, we analyze the effectiveness of different zero-cost proxies in ranking \gls{GCN} architectures, examine the impact of incorporating proxies in the \gls{NAS} algorithm and investigate the effectiveness of using an ensemble of proxies in \gls{NAS}.

Chapter 5 of the thesis presents the results of an investigation into the use of zero-cost proxies in neural architecture search for graph convolutional networks. The chapter includes a section on correlation and a vote section that analyze the effectiveness of different zero-cost proxies in ranking \gls{GCN} architectures. Additionally, a section on supervised learning using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation and Pointwise Ranking with Regression and Cross-Validation is included. Finally, the chapter addresses three research questions about the use of proxies in \gls{NAS} for \gls{GCN} and examines the impact of incorporating proxies in the \gls{NAS} algorithm and investigates the effectiveness of using an ensemble of proxies in \gls{NAS}.

This chapter outlines the study's findings, responding to the defined research questions. Next, the 'Correlation Analysis' section evaluates the capability of zero-cost proxies in ranking \gls{GCN} architectures concerning their validation accuracy. Subsequently, the analysis of correlation during the warm-up phase of \gls{GCN} training is identified. Lastly, the 'Vote' and 'Weighted Arithmetic Mean' section examines techniques for combining zero-cost proxies to improve efficiency and accuracy in \gls{NAS} algorithms.
