Chapter 3 of the thesis reviews the literature on NAS and GCN NAS. It covers the concept of zero-cost proxies in NAS and the key findings from research on the topic. Additionally, the chapter delves into recent research on GCN NAS, including automated graph neural networks and one-shot GNN NAS with dynamic search space. The chapter provides an understanding of the state-of-the-art in NAS and GCN NAS, which is essential for developing novel approaches to these problems. Also, the chapter highlights the gaps and limitations of the literature today.
