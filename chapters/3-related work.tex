Chapter 3 of the thesis reviews the literature on \gls{NAS} and \gls{GCN} \gls{NAS}. It covers the concept of zero-cost proxies in \gls{NAS} and the key findings from research on the topic. Additionally, the chapter delves into recent research on \gls{GCN} \gls{NAS}, including automated graph neural networks and one-shot \gls{GNN} \gls{NAS} with dynamic search space. The chapter provides an understanding of the state-of-the-art in \gls{NAS} and \gls{GCN} \gls{NAS}, which is essential for developing novel approaches to these problems. Also, the chapter highlights the gaps and limitations of the literature today.
