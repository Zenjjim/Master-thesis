\chapter{Theory}
\begin{comment}
This chapter will contain the essential theory for the thesis. 

As the authors did a literature review as a pre-study for this project, some subchapters will be re-used as the theory is still highly relevant for this thesis.

Chapter 2 of the thesis introduces the challenges of using machine learning with graphs and how \glspl{GCN} have emerged as a solution to these challenges. The chapter describes the core of \glspl{GCN}, the graph convolution operation, and how it aggregates local information from neighbouring nodes to generate a new representation for each node. The chapter also introduces \Gls{AutoML}, an emerging area of machine learning that seeks to automate designing optimal machine learning architectures. Finally, the chapter provides an overview of \gls{NAS}, a sub-field of \gls{AutoML} that aims to automate creating of high-performing neural networks and \gls{HAR}.
