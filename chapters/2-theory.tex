\chapter{Theory}

This chapter begins by discussing the fundamentals of deep learning and neural networks, setting the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of challenges with using machine learning on graphs. Further, the chapter describes the core of \glspl{GCN}, the graph convolution operation, and how it aggregates local information from neighbouring nodes to generate a new representation for each node. The chapter also introduces \Gls{AutoML}, an emerging area of machine learning that seeks to automate designing optimal machine learning architectures. In addition, the chapter provides an overview of \gls{NAS}, a sub-field of \gls{AutoML} that aims to automate the creation of high-performing neural networks. Finally, the field of HAR is presented. 

This chapter builds upon the unpublished specialisation project from the fall of 2022; portions of the work presented here originate from that project.
