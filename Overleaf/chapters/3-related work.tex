\chapter{Related work}\label{chapter3}

This chapter reviews the literature on \gls{NAS} and \gls{GCN}-\gls{NAS}. It covers the concept of zero-cost proxies in \gls{NAS} and the key findings from research on the topic. Additionally, the chapter presents recent research on \gls{GCN}-\gls{NAS}, including automated graph neural networks and one-shot \gls{GNN}-\gls{NAS} with dynamic search space. Also, the chapter highlights the gaps and limitations of the literature today.  

As there is no concrete literature on zero-cost proxies for GCN, we have chosen to include related work on other tasks (i.e. image classification) than HAR.

This chapter builds upon the unpublished specialisation project from the fall of 2022; portions of the work presented here originate from that project.
